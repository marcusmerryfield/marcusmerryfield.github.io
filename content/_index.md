    # A description for the paper.
    description: Dedicated surveys searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs) are subject to selection effects that bias the observed population of events. Software injection systems are one method of correcting for these biases by injecting a mock population of synthetic FRBs directly into the real-time search pipeline. This paper presents an injection system developed for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB).

# ü¶† Bio

I am a third year PhD student in the department of Physics at McGill studying fast radio bursts with Professor Vicky Kaspi in the CHIME Fast Radio Burst group. I helped build the [injection system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165..152M/abstract) for the project, which injects synthetic pulse data into the live telescope datastream as a way to help understand the search pipeline's selection biases.
